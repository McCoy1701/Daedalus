# This testing framework is designed for Dopamine-driven development
# It should Gamify, and help coders with ADHD feel a sense of accomplishment.
# It should also provide a thematic experience within the world of Greek mythology.
# The Sisyphus legend serves as a metaphor for perseverance and the pursuit of perfection.

# Set environment variable to indicate this is a full test run (1/N XP where N = successfully run files, no achievements)

        "🌅  DAEDALUS'S RITUAL|Before touching the blueprints, Daedalus stares east towards Athens, his expression a mixture of profound longing and bitter resentment for the city that exiled him."
        "🪨  THE SAME FIRST STEP|The rising sun illuminates the same chalk mark on the floor where yesterday's work began. You realize with a chill, Sisyphus, that every dawn begins in the exact same place."
        "👑  MINOS AT DAWN|The King is already watching from his balcony. He is not inspecting your work; he is staring at the Labyrinth's dark, silent entrance, as if expecting something to emerge."

        # --- Dialogue: Words at Sunrise ---
        "🗣️  DAEDALUS'S FIRST COMMAND|'Forget yesterday's victories, Sisyphus. The sun has risen, and it has revealed our failures. The King only cares about the progress we make today.'"
        "🗣️  A GUARD'S GRIM JOKE|The new guard bringing your breakfast mutters, 'Fresh bread for the builders, fresh meat for the beast. We all serve the Labyrinth's appetite, eh?'"
        "🗣️  THE ECHO OF A NIGHTMARE|Daedalus, pale and shaken, grabs your arm. 'I dreamt of my nephew, Talos. He was laughing and pointing at a single flaw in the foundation. Find it, Sisyphus. Find it now.'"

        # --- Storytelling: The Labyrinth at First Light ---
        "🌅  A CRUEL DAWN|The first rays of sun strike the Labyrinth walls, revealing a subtle flaw in the code you wrote by candlelight. The light of truth is a harsh inspector."
        "🌅  THE PALACE AWAKENS|The sounds of the waking palace echo from below. The secret, frantic work of the night must now become the deliberate, measured labor of the day."
        "📜  THE MORNING DECREE|A messenger arrives with the dawn, carrying a wax tablet. 'King Minos has a new requirement. A section of the maze must be redesigned by dusk.' The work is never done."

        # --- Character Building: Dawn Reflections ---
        "☕️  DAEDALUS'S FUEL|The architect drinks his morning brew, staring intently at the code. 'The night gives us mystery, Sisyphus, but the dawn gives us clarity. And clarity reveals mistakes.'"
        "🪨  NO RESPITE|As the sun crests the horizon, you realize the hope of a new day is an illusion. For you, Sisyphus, it is only the same boulder, now in a different light."
        "🩸  THE BEAST MUST FEED|A fleet of guards lead a tribute towards the Labyrinth's entrance as the sun rises. A stark reminder of the grim purpose of your perfect prison."

        # --- Dialogue: Words at Sunrise ---
        "🗣️  A HARSH AWAKENING|Daedalus points a trembling finger at a complex function. 'Look! What seemed like genius in the dark is madness in the light of day. Fix it. Now.'"
        "🗣️  THE CHANGING OF THE GUARD|A new sentry, seeing you already at work, mutters, 'You two never rest. Does the King have you building his tomb, or just hiding his secrets?'"
        "🗣️  A GRIM INVENTORY|Daedalus points to a pile of papyrus scrolls. 'Each of these is a flaw we thought was fixed yesterday. The dawn has shown us our folly. We begin again, Sisyphus.'"

        # --- The Nature of the Curse ---
        "🤔 A TASK WITHOUT MEANING|The sun rises, and with it, the gnawing question: Does perfecting this code truly matter? The boulder, at least, had the simple honesty of being pointless."
        "✨ THE ILLUSION OF CHOICE|You pick up a different tool this morning, start on a different function. A small act of rebellion. But by midday, you know all paths lead back to the same endless task."
        "🔥 A FATE WORSE THAN THE STONE|A horrifying thought strikes you as you begin to code: The gods did not simply change your punishment. They refined it. A boulder punishes the body, but a perfect, endless puzzle... that punishes the mind."

        # --- Whispers of the Palace ---
        "😡 THE KING'S MORNING RAGE|A muffled roar echoes from the royal chambers. A servant whispers that King Minos had another nightmare about his 'son' and has already executed a guard for looking at him wrong."
        "🥛 THE NURSEMAID'S PRAYER|You see the beast's old nursemaid leaving a small offering of milk and honey at a sealed-off entrance to the maze. She prays not to the gods, but to the stones themselves."
        "🤫 A SPY'S SHADOW|You catch a fleeting glimpse of a figure on a distant rooftop, watching your workshop through a polished bronze mirror. Daedalus was right. Someone is watching."

        # --- The Labyrinth's Awakening ---
        "🧠 A PATTERN IN THE BUGS|The errors from last night's code have... rearranged themselves. They form a new, more elegant problem. It feels less like a series of mistakes and more like an intelligent response."
        "🌀 THE MAZE'S FIRST BREATH|As the morning air warms the stones, a low, resonant hum emanates from the foundations. It is the sound of a vast machine stirring to life for the first time."
        "🏞️ A CORRIDOR OF MEMORY|You walk down a hall you finished yesterday, and for a moment, the cold stone walls seem to flicker with an image of a rolling green hill. The Labyrinth is showing you what you've lost."
    )

        # --- Character Building: Mid-Morning Tensions ---
        "📜  A SECRET KEY|You notice Daedalus using a separate, smaller set of scrolls for his most complex calculations, hiding them whenever a guard comes near. These are not part of the official plans."
        "⛓️  THE WEIGHT OF THE CURSE|You see a group of condemned tributes being marched from the docks toward the Labyrinth. Their vacant eyes meet yours, and you feel the true weight of the prison you are building."
        "🐂  THE BEAST'S ANGER|A shipment of massive, bronze-enforced stones arrives. Daedalus explains, 'The Minotaur broke through the inner wall again last night. My original designs were not strong enough.'"

        # --- Dialogue: Tense Morning Exchanges ---
        "🗣️  DAEDALUS'S PERFECTIONISM|'The bronze content in these hinges is insufficient,' Daedalus barks, throwing a component across the workshop. 'Tell the forge to triple the mix. The King's beast will not be contained by shoddy work.'"
        "🗣️  THE SILENT WATCHERS|The morning shift of guards is new. They do not speak. They only stand at the corners of the workshop, their eyes fixed on your hands as you code."
        "🗣️  A BIZARRE MODIFICATION|A new decree from Minos arrives. 'No right angles in the western wing,' Daedalus reads from a wax tablet, bewildered. 'The King says corners give false hope. He wants only curves.'"

        # --- Storytelling: The Labyrinth in the Full Light of Day ---
        "☀️ THE SUN'S HARSH GLARE|With the sun high in the sky, you and Daedalus can no longer hide your work. The sounds of your tools echo, and you feel the gaze of curious eyes from the palace walls."
        "🔍  THE ROYAL INSPECTION|A royally-appointed surveyor arrives unannounced, demanding to see the progress. 'King Minos wants assurances this structure is as inescapable as promised,' he sneers."
        "❓  A LOGICAL PARADOX|A corridor you perfected yesterday has inexplicably changed overnight. Daedalus suspects sabotage; you suspect the Labyrinth itself is actively resisting its own creation."

        # --- Character Building: Mid-Morning Tensions ---
        "🧠  SISYPHUS'S MENTAL FATIGUE|The physical weight of the boulder is gone, replaced by the crushing mental weight of endless logic puzzles. Each bug feels like the boulder slipping from your grasp, threatening to roll all the way back to the bottom."
        "🔬  DAEDALUS'S PARANOIA|The architect grows paranoid, his eyes darting at every shadow. He examines your code, whispering about Athenian spies sent to steal his Labyrinth's secrets."
        "👑  THE QUEEN'S SORROW|Queen Pasiphaë walks the palace gardens, always within sight of the tower where you work. Her gaze is not one of pride, but of profound, unending grief."

        # --- Dialogue: Tense Morning Exchanges ---
        "🗣️  DAEDALUS'S FRUSTRATION|'This function should be perfect! Did you follow the blueprint exactly, Sisyphus? Or has some god cursed this stone and code to defy my will?'"
        "🗣️  GOSSIPING GUARDS|Two sentries whisper as you pass. 'The architect is mad, they say. And his assistant... that one has the haunted look of a man who has seen Tartarus and returned.'"
        "🗣️  DAEDALUS'S GRIM REQUEST|The architect looks over his plans. 'We need more lead for the inner chamber doors, Sisyphus. Not for strength... to muffle the sounds. For the Queen's sake.'"

        # --- The King's Scrutiny ---
        "🗺️  THE KING'S MEASURE|A royal surveyor arrives with a perfectly balanced scale. 'King Minos demands we weigh every stone,' he says. 'He believes a single ounce of imperfection will compromise the entire structure.'"
        "🐦  THE SILENT BIRDS|Every morning, crows gather on the workshop roof. Today, they're completely silent, all facing the same direction - toward a tower that wasn't there yesterday. Daedalus pretends not to notice, but his hands shake as he draws."
        "🤫 A VOW OF SILENCE|A new royal decree is posted. The punishment for speaking of the 'architect's work' outside the palace walls is now death. The King is burying his secret in silence and terror."

        # --- The Labyrinth's Nature ---
        "🌀 IMPOSSIBLE GEOMETRY|You spend the morning building a perfectly straight corridor, only to return after lunch and find a slight, almost imperceptible curve in it. The stones have settled... or shifted."
        "💧 THE DRAIN OF VITALITY|The plants in the workshop have withered overnight, despite being watered. The air feels thin. It's as if the Labyrinth is drawing the life out of everything around it."
        "🗺️ THE FIRST MAZE|In a dusty crate, you find an older, smaller blueprint for a different maze. It's crossed out with a single word written in dried blood: 'INSUFFICIENT'."

        # --- The Weight of the Curse ---
        "🧠 THE LOGIC TRAP|You realize the most difficult bugs aren't errors in logic, but loops that are perfectly logical, yet never-ending. The code works exactly as designed... and that is the problem."
        "🎭 A COMEDY OF THE GODS|You fix a bug, and Daedalus immediately finds another. You see the humor in it—a dark, divine comedy where you are the punchline. You almost laugh."
        "⌛️ THE NATURE OF 'DONE'|You mark a module as 'complete.' The word feels hollow, meaningless. In this place, 'done' is just the quiet before the next bug report, the brief peace before the boulder rolls again."
    )

    declare -a afternoon_greetings=(
        # --- Character Building: Afternoon Despair ---
        "⏳  THE ILLUSION OF PROGRESS|Daedalus holds two identical-looking blueprints. 'I have fixed this bug seven times, Sisyphus. Every time, it returns in a new form. This maze... it heals itself.'"
        "⛓️  A PRISONER'S GAZE|You find Daedalus tracing the patterns of the iron bars on the workshop window. 'The perfect trap, Sisyphus,' he says quietly, 'is the one the prisoner helps you build.'"
        "🔥  THE HEAT OF THE FORGE|The afternoon heat reminds you of Tartarus. You wonder if this is a crueler hell: to be aware, to have a purpose, but to know that purpose is to build a monument to someone else's shame."

        # --- Dialogue: Heated Afternoon Exchanges ---
        "🗣️  THE SURVEYOR'S TAUNT|The royal inspector returns. 'Still at it? I wonder, architect, which is the greater marvel: your Labyrinth, or the King's patience with your endless delays?'"
        "🗣️  A DESPERATE BARGAIN|Daedalus whispers to you, his eyes wide. 'If you help me with my... personal project... I can create a flaw in the maze only we know. A way out, for both of us.'"
        "🗣️  THE MINOTAUR'S LAMENT|Amidst the pounding of hammers, you hear a new sound from below: not a roar of rage, but a long, sorrowful bellow. It is a sound of profound loneliness."

        # --- Storytelling: The Labyrinth Under the Oppressive Sun ---
        "🔎  AN IMPOSSIBLE DISCOVERY|Daedalus holds up a blueprint, his hands shaking. 'This sequence is not mine. Someone has sabotaged the core logic!' The paranoia of the morning now feels terrifyingly real."
        "😱  A SCREAM FROM BELOW|A piercing scream echoes from the Labyrinth's lower levels, abruptly silenced. The palace guards look at each other, then quickly look away.|Your 'bug-fixes' and 'features' are not abstract concepts. They are the stone and mortar of a tomb. The work continues."
        "🧠  THE ARCHITECT'S MADNESS|You find Daedalus carving equations directly onto the stone walls of his chamber. 'The papyrus lies!' he screams. 'The truth is in the stone! Only the stone!'"

        # --- Character Building: Afternoon Despair ---
        "⛓️  SISYPHUS'S REALIZATION|You realize this is worse than the boulder. The boulder was honest in its absurdity. This Labyrinth pretends to have a solution, a final perfect state, but you suspect it's a lie."
        "✍️  DAEDALUS'S FRANTIC SKETCHES|The architect, slick with sweat, abandons the main blueprints and furiously sketches on a scrap of papyrus. It’s a wing, made of feathers and wax. A desperate, mad idea."
        "🐂  THE LABYRINTH TREMBLES|A low, rhythmic *thud* echoes from deep within the maze, shaking the dust from the stones. The Minotaur is not resting. It is testing your work, Sisyphus, looking for a flaw."

        # --- Dialogue: Heated Afternoon Exchanges ---
        "🗣️ MINOS'S THREAT|The King, walking the grounds below, shouts up at the tower. 'The tribute from Athens arrives in three days, Daedalus! If this maze is not ready to receive them, your son will be the first to test its corridors!'"
        "🗣️ A SKEPTICAL GUARD|A passing sentry looks at your complex work and scoffs. 'All this stone and genius to hold one boy? I think the King's true monster is his own pride.'"
        "🗣️ A CHILLING REALIZATION|Daedalus stops you before you enter a newly completed section. 'Wait. I designed this corridor to be inescapable from the inside. Let us pray, Sisyphus, that the King never asks us to walk it.'"

        # --- The Labyrinth's Malevolence ---
        "🩸 THE WALLS BLEED|The oppressive heat makes the newly-laid mortar sweat a strange, red dust, like the stone itself is weeping blood. The Labyrinth feels sickly, alive."
        "🌀 A SHIFTING PERSPECTIVE|You look at a section of code you wrote this morning and no longer recognize it. The logic seems alien, hostile. It's as if the Labyrinth is rewriting itself behind you."
        "👂 UNHEARD MELODIES|Daedalus puts his ear to a wall. 'Do you hear that? A song... but the notes are all wrong. The harmony is a weapon.' You hear nothing but the wind."

        # --- The Weight of Secrets ---
        "🔑 THE HIDDEN KEY|While organizing scrolls, you find a complex diagram for a key, one unlike any you've seen. Daedalus snatches it from your hands. 'That is for a door that does not yet exist,' he hisses."
        "📜 THE SECOND LEDGER|You discover Daedalus keeps two sets of progress reports. One, filled with triumphs, is for the King. The other, filled with cryptic warnings and sketches of wings, is for himself."
        "👥 THE SHADOW COUNCIL|You see Daedalus meeting in a secluded courtyard with two figures you don't recognize. They are not Cretan. They speak in a rapid, hushed Athenian dialect."

        # --- Echoes of the Past ---
        "🐦 THE PARTRIDGE'S CURSE|A single partridge lands on the windowsill. Daedalus freezes, his face contorted in a mask of pure terror, until the bird flies away. He does not speak for an hour."
        "💬 A GUARD'S QUESTION|A curious sentry asks you what it was like in Tartarus. You look at the endless, complex code before you and reply, 'This is worse. In Tartarus, at least I knew what the punishment was.'"
        "🔥 THE FLAMES OF ENVY|'I was celebrated in Athens,' Daedalus mutters to the forge fire. 'Now I am a zookeeper for a king's shame. A fine legacy, built from the ashes of my own jealousy.'"

        # --- Character Building: Evening Thoughts ---
        "🗺️ THE LABYRINTH'S HEART|Daedalus reveals the center of the blueprint. It is not a room, but a complex, shifting mechanism. 'It is designed to constantly reconfigure,' he says, 'so that even I will not know the true path.'"
        "🦉 SISYPHUS'S VOW|Watching the sunset, you make a silent promise. You may be cursed to this task, but you will learn every secret of this code. You will know this Labyrinth better than its own creator."
        "🧠 A SENTIENT DESIGN|Daedalus stares at the completed western wing blueprint. 'It is no longer just a design, Sisyphus,' he whispers. 'The logic has become... aware. It learns from those who enter. It *hunts*.'"

        # --- Dialogue: Voices in the Gloom ---
        "🗣️  THE GHOST IN THE MACHINE|'I know there's an error in the central routing logic,' Daedalus whispers, holding a candle to a blueprint. 'I can *feel* it, like a cold draft from a crack in the stone, but the plans say it's perfect.'"
        "🗣️  A GUARD'S PHILOSOPHY|An old sentry, watching you work late, says quietly, 'I've seen many men build their own prisons. You are the first I've seen who seems to understand the shape of it.'"
        "🗣️  THE EVOLVING BEAST|'The sounds from the maze are changing,' Daedalus murmurs, listening intently. 'The rage is less frequent now. I hear... a lament. A beast that is beginning to understand its own purpose.'"

        # --- Storytelling: The Labyrinth at Dusk ---
        "🌆 LABYRINTH AT TWILIGHT|As the sun sets over Crete, the Labyrinth's shadows lengthen, twisting the corridors into new, more confusing shapes. The work must continue by torchlight."
        "🔥 THE NIGHT'S WORK BEGINS|Daedalus unrolls fresh blueprints under the evening stars. The most intricate and secret parts of the maze are designed while the rest of the kingdom sleeps."
        "🌙 A REPORT FOR THE KING|A palace guard arrives, his torch casting long shadows. 'King Minos demands a report on the day's progress. He grows impatient to see his masterpiece complete.'"

        # --- Character Building: Evening Thoughts ---
        "🦉 DAEDALUS'S OBSESSION|The master architect doesn't sleep. He stalks the corridors at night, muttering about angles and dead-ends, his mind consumed by the perfect prison."
        "🐂 THE MINOTAUR WAKES|As darkness falls, a low growl echoes from deep within the half-finished maze. The beast knows you are building its cage, and it despises the encroaching stone."
        "🪨 A NEW KIND OF BURDEN|Sisyphus, as you rest your weary bones, you realize this is a different curse. The boulder was mindless; the code is a puzzle that follows you into your dreams."

        # --- Dialogue: Voices in the Gloom ---
        "🗣️  DAEDALUS'S WHISPER|'Bring the lanterns, Sisyphus. The day is for labor, but the night is for genius. Let us solve this puzzle before the sun returns.'"
        "🗣️  A CRETAN'S WARNING|An old guard whispers to you, 'Be wary. These walls hear everything at night. Even the King's secrets are not safe within this maze.'"
        "🗣️  THE HERO'S VOW|A faint echo on the sea breeze sounds like a young man's voice... 'Ariadne, I swear on this evening star, I will conquer the maze and end this terror.'"

        # --- The Labyrinth's Deepening Mystery ---
        "🧩 THE PUZZLE SOLVER|'It's learning,' Daedalus says, his voice hollow. 'I laid a false path yesterday as a test. Today, the stones are rearranged. It's not just a prisoner, Sisyphus. It's a rival architect.'"
        "🎶 A HAUNTING MELODY|Daedalus stops working, his head cocked. 'That sound... it's not a growl. It's a song. The Queen used to sing it to him.' The faint, distorted melody is deeply unsettling."
        "🔒 THE FORBIDDEN DOOR|Daedalus points to a section of the plan. 'This door must never be opened once sealed. Not by you, not by me, not even by Minos himself. Swear it, Sisyphus.'"

        # --- The Weight of the Curse ---
        "💰 A SILENT PAYMENT|A palace official leaves a heavy purse of gold on the table without a word. The payment feels less like a salary and more like a bribe to ensure your silence."
        "📜 THE UNSEEN CLAUSE|You notice fine print on a blueprint you've never seen before. It's a contract, binding Daedalus to the King's service until 'the project and all its secrets are secure.'"
        "🌀 THE CYCLE REVEALED|You fix a bug in a function, and watch in dawning horror as an identical, but subtly different, bug appears in a library you completed weeks ago. The Labyrinth does not want to be finished."

        # --- Echoes of the Outside World ---
        "🚢 A SHIP IN THE NIGHT|A single ship with black sails slips into the harbor under the cover of darkness. It carries no cargo, only passengers who do not disembark in the main port. The tribute system has begun."
        "🎭 THE FORGOTTEN STAGE|'I once designed moving stages for the theaters in Athens,' Daedalus says wistfully, looking at a complex gear mechanism. 'Now I build only cages. A fine use of my talents.'"
        "🦉 ATHENA'S SILENCE|'She has abandoned me,' Daedalus mutters, looking up at the sky. 'Athena, my patron, my guide... she has been silent ever since I arrived on this cursed island. There is no wisdom here. Only madness.'"

        "🤫  THE HIDDEN PASSAGE|While reviewing the day's code, you spot it: a single, commented-out function. A backdoor. You look over at Daedalus, but he is sleeping. You wonder if he left it intentionally, or if he's forgotten it's there."
        "❓  AN IMPOSSIBLE FLANK|You trace a path for the Minotaur to its chamber, but realize the logic creates a perfect pincer, trapping not just the beast, but anyone who pursues it. You wonder if the Labyrinth's true prey is the hero, not the monster."
        "🩸  THE BLOOD MOON|A lunar eclipse casts a red glow over the workshop. Daedalus wakes with a start, screaming a name you don't recognize: 'Perdix!' He stares at his hands in horror before collapsing back into sleep."

        # --- Dialogue: Whispers After Midnight ---
        "🗣️  'IT HAS NO CENTER'|Daedalus, speaking in his sleep, murmurs, 'The secret... Sisyphus... is that the maze has no center. The Minotaur is just... the first prisoner. The true monster is the Labyrinth itself.'"
        "🗣️  A VOICE FROM THE WALLS|'Listen...' Daedalus whispers, his eyes wide with terror. 'The walls... I hear whispers from the stone. It's speaking in an Athenian dialect. It knows where I came from.'"
        "🗣️  KING MINOS IN THE DARK|You look down and see a single figure walking the perimeter of the Labyrinth in the dead of night. It is King Minos, alone, inspecting the prison that holds his greatest shame and his greatest weapon."

        # --- Storytelling: The Labyrinth in the Deep Night ---
        "🤫  SECRETS IN THE STONE|In the dead of night, the Labyrinth seems to breathe. The stones shift, revealing passages that Daedalus himself doesn't remember designing. The maze has a will of its own."
        "🗺️  A FORGOTTEN BLUEPRINT|You find a hidden scroll under a loose floor tile. It's an older, more chaotic design for the Labyrinth, signed by Daedalus with a trembling hand and a note: 'Too dangerous.'"
        "🕯️  THE LAST CANDLE BURNS|The entire palace sleeps, but you and Daedalus work on. The final candle flickers, its small light a lonely beacon against the immense, dark puzzle of the code."

        # --- Character Building: Late Night Reflections ---
        "🤔  SISYPHUS'S REALIZATION|You stare at a complex function and realize the true curse isn't the boulder, but the tantalizing proximity of a perfect, elegant solution that is always just one step away."
        "👑  MINOS'S NIGHTMARES|Even the King of Crete cannot rest. He is haunted by dreams of his son, the Minotaur, and the fear that even Daedalus's genius cannot contain his rage forever."
        "🐂  THE BEAST IN THE DARK|In the profound silence of midnight, you can almost hear the Minotaur's slow, heavy breathing. It is not sleeping. It is waiting. The code must be perfect to hold it."

        # --- Dialogue: Whispers After Midnight ---
        "🗣️  DAEDALUS'S CONFESSION|The architect, weary and half-asleep, looks at you. 'I fear what I have built, Sisyphus. I fear this logic we've created is a trap for more than just the monster.'"
        "🗣️  A PALACE SERVANT'S WHISPER|A servant, fetching water in the dead of night, whispers to you, 'I pity the creature. They say it's the Queen's own son. King Minos builds this maze to hide his own shame.'"
        "🗣️  DAEDALUS'S LATE NIGHT DOUBT|The architect stares into the flickering lamplight. 'I worry, Sisyphus. What if the Labyrinth is too perfect? What if we build a prison that even its own creator cannot escape?'"

        # --- The Labyrinth's True Nature ---
        "🧠 THE LIVING ARITHMETIC|Daedalus traces a line of code. 'This is not architecture, Sisyphus. This is a calculation that thinks. We are not building walls; we are teaching a god how to reason.'"
        "🌀 THE ENDLESS CORRIDOR|You find a logical loop that, by all accounts, should be infinite. Yet, it terminates. When you ask Daedalus, he simply says, 'The Labyrinth permits it. Do not question its nature.'"
        "🎯 A PRISON FOR THOUGHTS|'Do you see now?' Daedalus whispers, pointing to the dizzying array of functions. 'This maze will not contain a beast of flesh and bone. It is designed to trap a mind. Any mind.'"

        # --- The Architect's Guilt ---
        "👻 A RIVAL'S GHOST|'He was better than me,' Daedalus mutters, staring at an elegant function you wrote. 'So much promise. Such a waste.' He is not talking about your code."
        "🗼 THE VIEW FROM THE ACROPOLIS|Daedalus stands by the high window, looking down. 'From a great height,' he says, his voice hollow, 'everything looks small enough to be discarded. A dangerous perspective.'"
        "👐 THE IDLE HANDS OF A MURDERER|You see Daedalus holding his hands over the candlelight, examining them. 'These hands have created wonders,' he whispers, 'and committed horrors. I wonder which the gods will remember.'"

        # --- The Prisoner's Perspective ---
        "🪨 THE ECHOING BOULDER|In the dead silence, you can almost hear the scrape of a great boulder on a stone path. You realize with horror that the sound is only in your head, a memory of a simpler torment."
        "🤝 A SHARED DAMNATION|You press your ear to the floor and hear a faint, rhythmic tapping from below. One-two. One-two. The Minotaur is not raging. It is counting the seconds, just as you are."
        "🎭 PERFECTION FOR NO ONE|A chilling thought: you are building a perfect prison that no one will ever see, to contain a creature whose only crime was being born. Your eternal labor serves only to hide a King's shame."

        # --- Theme: A Cruel Renewal ---
        "🌸 A MOCKERY OF SPRING|Flowers bloom outside the tower walls, a bitter jest from the gods. For you, Sisyphus, there is no renewal, only the same code, the same stones, the same eternal beginning."
        "🌱 THE FIRST TRIBUTE|Spring brings the first black-sailed ships from Athens. The tributes, meant to test the maze, arrive with the season of sacrifice. Daedalus bars the workshop door."
        "🦋 A FLUTTER OF FALSE HOPE|A butterfly lands on the windowsill. Daedalus watches it, his face a mask of envy, before turning back to the blueprints. 'There is no escape for us,' he mutters."
        "💧 DEMETER'S BARGAIN|The earth is reborn, but Queen Pasiphaë's sorrow does not lift. She made a bargain for her monstrous son's life, and the price is this perfect, inescapable prison you build."
        "🤔 A FOOL'S HOPE|You watch the new growth outside and a foolish thought enters your mind: 'Perhaps this time will be different. Perhaps this time, the code will hold.' You know it is a lie, but you believe it for a moment."
        "🗣️ DAEDALUS'S DECREE|'The spring rains have weakened the foundation,' Daedalus declares, pointing to a fresh crack. 'Everything we built last season is now suspect. We must verify it all again, from the beginning.'"

        "🔥 THE FORGE OF HELL|The summer sun turns the workshop into an oven. Daedalus claims the heat reminds him of Hephaestus's forge, but his wild eyes tell you it reminds him more of the fires of Tartarus."
        "🔥 MINOS'S BURNING GAZE|The King spends the long, hot days watching your progress from his shaded balcony. His impatience grows with the heat, his demands becoming more erratic and impossible."
        "🐍 A PLAGUE OF ERRORS|The oppressive heat seems to spawn bugs like insects in a swamp. Every line of code you fix, two more seem to appear in its place, as if the Labyrinth itself is feverish."
        "🌊 THE SALT-STAINED BLUEPRINTS|The sea air is thick and heavy. The papyrus scrolls curl with dampness, blurring the lines of the master plan. Daedalus accuses the sea god himself of trying to sabotage his work."
        "🤔 A FAMILIAR BURN|The heat of the forge where the Labyrinth's iron is shaped feels familiar. You recall the flames of the underworld and wonder which punishment is worse: a simple, honest fire, or this sun-baked intellectual torment."
        "🗣️ A GUARD'S CYNICISM|A guard, bringing you water, mutters, 'The King hides from the sun while we toil in it. He fears the light will reveal the true monster is not the one in the maze.'"

        "🌬️ A CHILLING WIND|The first autumn wind howls through the tower, scattering scrolls. For a moment, it sounds like a scream from the maze below. Daedalus doesn't even flinch anymore."
        "🥀 THE QUEEN'S GARDEN WILTS|Queen Pasiphaë no longer walks the gardens. The flowers have died, and she remains in her chambers. Her sorrow has consumed the season, a blight upon the land."
        "🦉 THE OWL'S JUDGMENT|An owl, Athena's sacred bird, lands on the windowsill each evening. Daedalus, once her favored craftsman, refuses to look at it, as if terrified of the wisdom—or condemnation—it might offer."
        "🤔 A HARVEST OF NOTHING|You watch the farmers bringing in their bounty. You have labored just as they have, yet your only harvest is a more perfect prison, a more complete damnation. There is no crop to gather from your work."
        "🗣️ THE HERO'S ARRIVAL|'A ship from Athens,' the guard captain reports to Daedalus. 'It carries a volunteer. A prince named Theseus. He says he has come to slay the beast.' Daedalus only smiles, a thin, cruel line on his lips."

        "🥶 THE POINT OF NO RETURN|Trapped by winter storms, Daedalus stares at the master blueprint for days without speaking. At last, he whispers, 'Sisyphus... I have designed it so perfectly that I no longer know the way out myself.'"
        "🕯️ THE ETERNAL NIGHT|The nights are longest now. You have more hours in the dark with the code than in the light. You feel more at home in the logical maze of the blueprints than in the waking world."
        "🧊 A FROZEN HEART|King Minos's demands cease. He no longer watches from his balcony. In the cold of winter, even his rage seems to have frozen, replaced by a cold, calculating acceptance of the monster he keeps."
        "🤔 A COLD COMFORT|The biting winter wind feels like a relief. It is a clean, honest pain, unlike the twisted, complex agony of a recursive function with no exit condition."
        "🗣️ DAEDALUS'S CHILLING PROPHECY|'The Labyrinth will be finished when the winter ends, Sisyphus,' Daedalus says, his breath misting in the cold air. 'And when it is... the King has no more use for its architect. Or his assistant.'"

        "🏛️ THE ARRIVAL|You are brought to a high tower in the palace of Knossos. A man with haunted eyes introduces himself as Daedalus. 'King Minos has a task for us,' he says. 'A glorious, eternal task.'"
        "🪨 THE FIRST COMMIT|Daedalus unrolls a vast, impossibly complex blueprint. 'Your curse has been... updated, Sisyphus. The gods grew bored of the boulder. Minos, however, has a use for your persistence.'"
        "👑 THE KING'S DECREE|King Minos addresses you from his throne, not looking at you. 'You will help my architect build a prison of logic and stone. It will be perfect. It will be endless. You will not fail.'"
        "⛓️ THE WEIGHT OF CODE|Your first bug. A simple off-by-one error. As you fix it, you feel a familiar weight settle on your shoulders. It is not stone, but the infinite mass of possibility."
        "🐂 A DISTANT ROAR|From somewhere deep below the foundations, a sound echoes—a roar of immense pain and rage. Daedalus flinches. 'Pay it no mind,' he says quickly. 'It is merely the... client.'"
        "🌅 THE FIRST SUNRISE|The Cretan sun reveals the dust motes dancing in the air. You did not sleep. You realize with a cold dread that in this new hell, fatigue is a luxury you are no longer afforded."
        "☕️ DAEDALUS'S WHISPER|The architect leans in, his breath smelling of stale wine. 'The King believes he is our master. He is wrong. We are slaves to this... this *idea*. The Labyrinth. It commands us now.'"
        "📜 THE UNREADABLE CONTRACT|A scroll is delivered, outlining your duties. The text shifts and writhes as you try to read it. The only clear clause is the last: 'The work will be complete when it is perfect. The work will never be complete.'"
        "🕊️ THE GHOST OF ATHENS|Daedalus stares east towards his homeland. 'They exiled me for one death,' he mutters. 'Here, they celebrate me for building a tomb that will consume thousands.'"
        "🤔 A FAMILIAR FEELING|You complete a complex function, and for a fleeting moment, you feel a sense of accomplishment. Then, the bug report arrives. The boulder has just rolled back to the bottom of the hill."

        "💧 THE WALLS WEEP|A strange, damp residue slicks the stones in a newly finished section. It smells of salt and sorrow. 'The stone of Crete is porous,' Daedalus explains, but he won't touch the walls."
        "🤫 THE SECRET LANGUAGE|Daedalus begins using a complex series of symbols only he understands. He calls it 'commenting his work.' You realize it is a second, hidden language embedded within the first."
        "👑 THE QUEEN'S VIGIL|You learn that Queen Pasiphaë provides the beast's food herself, leaving it at the Labyrinth's entrance each day. She has never seen the creature since its birth."
        "🐂 THE BEAST'S INTELLIGENCE|A section of wall is found battered from the inside, but not randomly. The impacts are focused on a single, load-bearing keystone. 'It's learning,' Daedalus whispers in horror."
        "🗣️ MINOS'S PARANOIA|'The tribute from Athens... it is a lie,' Minos rants during an inspection. 'They send not victims, but saboteurs! Their hero, Theseus, will try to steal my creation! Make it deadlier!'"
        "🧠 THE LOGIC'S ECHO|When you fix a particularly nasty bug, you can almost feel a ripple of... disappointment... emanate from the structure itself. The Labyrinth did not want that flaw removed."
        "🐦 A FEATHER ON THE FLOOR|You find a single, large feather near the forge—not from any bird you recognize. Daedalus snatches it and throws it into the flames, his face pale with a fear you do not yet understand."
        "🤝 THE SISYPHEAN COMPACT|'You are cursed to push, I am cursed to build,' Daedalus says, sharing his wine with you. 'Our fates are now intertwined. We will either perfect this place together or go mad in the attempt.'"
        "❓ A QUESTION OF PURPOSE|You ask Daedalus what happens when the Labyrinth is finished. He laughs, a dry, cracking sound. 'Finished? My boy, you still think this is about *building* something.'"

        # The Revelation Begins
        "🎭 THE FIRST CRACK IN THE MASK|You catch Daedalus smiling - genuinely smiling - at a particularly elegant solution you've written. 'You know,' he says, 'Perdix would have liked that approach.' His face immediately darkens, but the moment of humanity lingers."
        "✨ SISYPHUS'S FIRST CHOICE|You discover a critical flaw that would let someone escape. Your hand hovers over the keyboard. For the first time in eternity, you have a choice. You document it in a comment: '// TODO: Never fix this.'"
        "🕊️ THE FEATHER'S SECRET|You find another feather, but this time you hide it before Daedalus sees. That night, you study it by candlelight. It's perfectly engineered - each barb calculated for maximum lift. Someone is planning to fly."
        "💝 AN UNEXPECTED ALLY|A young servant girl leaves bread and wine at your workstation. 'My sister was in last year's tribute,' she whispers. 'Whatever kindness you can build into those walls...' She doesn't finish. She doesn't need to."
        "🗝️ THE HIDDEN PATTERN|You realize Daedalus has been embedding a pattern in his 'errors' - they're not mistakes, they're messages. When decoded, they spell out: 'THE MONSTER IS NOT THE ONLY PRISONER HERE.'"
        "🌟 SISYPHUS THE TEACHER|A young apprentice is assigned to help you. You find yourself explaining not just the code, but the beauty in the logic. For a moment, you remember: you were once more than just a curse. You were a king who loved to build."
        "🎪 THE GAME WITHIN THE GAME|You start leaving your own messages in the code. Small jokes. Elegant solutions that serve no purpose but beauty. If you must push this boulder, you'll choose HOW you push it."
        "🔮 THE ORACLE'S VISIT|A priestess arrives, claiming to need to bless the structure. She looks directly at you: 'The gods are watching, Sisyphus. But perhaps... they're not the only ones who can change the rules of the game.'"
        "🦅 DAEDALUS'S CONFESSION|After too much wine, Daedalus admits: 'I've built two labyrinths, Sisyphus. One of stone that holds the beast. One of guilt that holds me. But you... you're building a third one. What does yours contain?'"
        "💪 THE BOULDER BECOMES LIGHTER|Something strange happens. As you fix a particularly complex bug, you feel... joy? The boulder is still there, but for the first time, you're not just pushing it. You're sculpting it."

    # --- ACT IV: INESCAPABLE TRUTHS (LEVELS 31-40) ---
    # Theme: The climax. The major secrets are revealed, confronting the characters with the full horror of their situation.
    declare -a act_four_greetings=(
        # The Alliance Forms
        "🤝 THE ARCHITECT'S PROPOSITION|Daedalus pulls you aside, his eyes clear for the first time in months. 'I know what you've been doing with the code. The hidden paths. Help me save my son, and I'll help you save your soul.'"
        "🗺️ THE TRUE LABYRINTH|'The Labyrinth isn't the building,' Daedalus reveals, showing you the REAL blueprint. 'It's the entire palace. The entire kingdom. Every person trapped in their role. But we're going to build an exit - for everyone.'"
        "✍️ CODE NAMES|You and Daedalus develop a secret language within the code. Variables named after hope. Functions that sound like prayers. Every bug fix now carries a hidden purpose: creating a backdoor to freedom."
        "🎭 THE PERFORMANCE|You play your roles perfectly by day - the cursed king and the mad architect. But by night, you're revolutionaries, encoding escape routes in error messages, hiding wings in exception handlers."
        "👑 MINOS'S BLINDNESS|The King inspects your work, praising its perfection. He cannot see that every 'perfect' function contains a flaw that only you and Daedalus know. Pride has made him blind. You exchange the briefest glance with Daedalus - a smile."
        "🌅 THE COUNTDOWN BEGINS|'Three more moons,' Daedalus whispers. 'When the spring tribute arrives, we fly. But first, we must ensure the Labyrinth can be solved. No more children will die in our creation.'"
        "💡 SISYPHUS'S INNOVATION|You realize something Daedalus hasn't: the curse can be turned into a gift. Your eternal persistence means you can test every possible path. You begin mapping EVERY route through the maze, creating the ultimate walkthrough."
        "🎪 THE SECRET THREAD|You embed a algorithm in the Labyrinth's core: anyone who enters with love in their heart will find the walls themselves guiding them to safety. Ariadne's thread will work because you're making sure it will."
        "🔥 THE FORGING OF HOPE|Together, you and Daedalus work on the wings. But these aren't just wings of wax and feathers. They're wings of code, of logic, of perfectly calculated rebellion. Each feather is a function. Each function is a prayer."
        "⚡ THE MOMENT OF TRUTH|'Tomorrow, we test them,' Daedalus says, holding up the wings. 'If they fail, we remain prisoners. If they succeed...' He looks at you. 'Friend, if they succeed, even the gods will learn that mortals can rewrite their fates.'"

    # --- ACT V: THE ETERNAL CYCLE (LEVELS 41-50) ---
    # Theme: The resolution. The acceptance of the absurd. The Labyrinth is "done," but the work never ends.
    declare -a act_five_greetings=(
        # The Philosophical Climax
        "🌅 THE MORNING OF ESCAPE|Dawn breaks. The wings are ready. Daedalus straps them on his son. But as you prepare your own set, you realize something: you're not sure you want to leave. This curse, this code, it's become... yours."
        "🕊️ ICARUS SOARS|You watch the boy fly, laughing with pure joy. For a moment, all the pain, all the labor, all the endless debugging - it was worth it to see this one soul truly free. Then the sun grows hot..."
        "💔 THE FALL AND THE CHOICE|Icarus falls. Daedalus screams. But you... you're already at the terminal, coding. If you can't save the boy, you can save the next one. And the next. And the next. Your curse has become your purpose."
        "🎭 THE KING'S OFFER|Minos finds you at your terminal. 'Daedalus has fled. You could follow. I won't stop you.' He pauses. 'Or you could stay. Maintain the Labyrinth. Save those who enter. Your choice, Sisyphus.' But you've already chosen."
        "✨ THE REVELATION|As you code, you understand: The gods didn't curse you to push a boulder. They gave you the only gift that matters - eternal purpose. Every bug is a life saved. Every fix is a small rebellion against fate."
        "🏛️ THE NEW MYTHOLOGY|You embed a message in the Labyrinth's core: 'HERE WORKED SISYPHUS, WHO CHOSE HIS STONE.' Future heroes will find it and understand: sometimes the greatest freedom is choosing your own chains."
        "🌊 THE ETERNAL DEBUGGER|A new error appears. You smile. Tomorrow there will be more. Forever there will be more. But each one is a chance to save someone, to improve something, to create meaning from meaninglessness. You begin to type."
        "💪 THE HAPPY SISYPHUS|You push back from your terminal and laugh - a real, deep laugh. The gods wanted to break you with eternal labor. Instead, you've become unbreakable. The boulder rolls down. You crack your knuckles. 'Again,' you say, and mean it."
        "🎨 THE MASTERPIECE NEVER ENDS|New tributes arrive. You've hidden seventeen different escape routes in the code. Theseus will find his thread because you put it there. Heroes succeed because Sisyphus ensures it. Your curse is their salvation."
        "♾️ ONE MUST IMAGINE SISYPHUS CODING|The sun sets. It rises. The bugs appear. You fix them. But now you know the secret - in the space between the bug and the fix, in that moment of problem-solving, you are completely, perfectly, eternally free. The cursor blinks. You smile. Time to push the boulder up the hill again. And you wouldn't have it any other way."
